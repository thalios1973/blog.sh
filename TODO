- RSS or ATOM feed capability

- Static page support
 
- Provide additional template placeholder options (e.g. title, subtitle,
    baseurl for home links, etc.). Should make it easier to just get
    started
  - .config will need to be extended to support this as well

- Create basic template to include as default -- could make use of the
    extended template placeholder options

  - Maybe a "draft" directory?
