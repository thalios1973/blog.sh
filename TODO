X Implement tag parsing and tag page building.

x Fix a date format for the date line on each post.

- Implement ability to edit and delete posts.

- Need RSS or ATOM feed capability

- Review ability to create a "static" page -- e.g. content that is different from your standard blog post. Do I want this feature. How would it be different than a regular blog post? I guess it could be pretty much a blog post, but it shows up differently by not being listed in the tags/all listing and doesn't get included in the front page.
  - Implement if you decide you want it.

- Rework make_index so it's portable for other uses in the script
  - Build a list of files and pass that into the make_index

x Implement a preview URL scheme
  - Maybe a "draft" directory?
