## TODO List

- [ ] Static page support

    extended template placeholder options

- [ ] Create default .config file (with examples and such)

- [ ] Document the classes and ids available for CSS

- [ ] Implement ability to delete posts (low priority)

- [x] RSS or ATOM feed capability

- [x] Implement a preview URL scheme
